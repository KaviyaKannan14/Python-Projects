#This is a small fun code that I've created in Python. To work out the love score between two people:
#The code takes both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs.
#Then it checks for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs.
#Then the code combines these numbers to make a 2 digit number.

print("The Love Calculator is calculating your score...")

name2 = input() # What is their name?

l = lower_case.count("l")
o = lower_case.count("o")
v = lower_case.count("v")
